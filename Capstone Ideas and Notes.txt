US Traffic Data dataset was being used by another classmate, so I had to find a new one. The dataset I found is for the weather measurements in Vancouver recorded hourly for the past 90,000 hours (10 years).

I am hoping to find trends in the data for the temperatures, specially for the heat in the summer. Perhaps the hot temperatures we have been experiencing happened a few years back. The current independent variable is temperature, but this will be confirmed after the Basic EDA.

Data Cleaning with Excel:
1. Consolidated and converted cloud cover columns into one.
2. Filled in blank values for wind_dir column based on the degrees stated on wind_dir_10s.
3. Removed unixtime column because its redundant, we already have a datetime column.
4. Removed Solar Radiation, column was empty for the data set.

Notes for Python Cleaning:
- Wind_gust empty values suggest there was no wind gust that hour.
- Wind chill empty values can be filled with 0 if the missing values correspond to days when it is not cold.
- Wind dir and wind dir 10 values can be assumed to be 0 or null, no wind was recorded.
- Will need to be back or front filled:
	+ Relative_humidity
	+ dew_point
	+ temperature 
	+ humidex
	+ visibility
	+ air quality index
	+ max air temp
	+ min air temp
